# Dissertation_article_Prior-aware-Bayesian-optimisation-of-PES-minima
This project applies Bayesian Optimisation (BO) with Gaussian Process surrogates to locate molecular PES minima. Adapting the BEACON framework from solids to molecules, it benchmarks three priors (no prior, Lennard-Jones, and MACE) on NH₃, PF₃Cl₂, and C₃H₆O to assess robustness, efficiency, and prior influence on optimisation.
